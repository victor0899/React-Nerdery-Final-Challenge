TypeScript: Offers static type-checking to improve code reliability and developer productivity by minimizing runtime errors.
TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework that ensures a flexible, customizable design for all user interfaces while speeding up the development process.
Vite: A modern and high-performance build tool that ensures fast and optimized builds for both development and production environments.
Zustand: Provides lightweight and simple state management across the app, making global state accessible without introducing complex boilerplate code.
React Router: A library for client-side routing to handle transitions between pages seamlessly, improving user navigation throughout the application.
This project is designed with modern best practices in mind, with an emphasis on scalability, maintainability, and developer-friendly tooling.
